# Implementation Checklist

## Component Support
- [x] Add `asChild` support to `MenuCTASection` so it renders as a div when embedded.

## Menu Page Updates
- [x] Restyle the "Explore the menu" section for light theme.
- [x] Merge "Plan your visit" and CTA content into a single section, reusing the inline CTA card.

## Validation
- [x] Run relevant unit tests (MenuCTASection) if component updated.
- [x] Prepare for manual QA via Chrome DevTools and record results in verification doc.

## Notes / Assumptions
- Alternating background rhythm targets the main content blocks; hero styling remains unchanged.
