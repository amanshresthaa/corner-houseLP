- Timestamp: 2025-12-08 18:42
- Target: /contact route (localhost:3001)

## Initial Requirements
- Align contact page with simplified booking/contact approach (no booking form), emphasizing clear CTAs and essentials.
- Remove redundant or verbose sections; keep concise hero + key actions + hours/map/contact info.
- Maintain accessibility, mobile-first layout, DaisyUI usage, and reduce-motion support.

## Success Criteria
- Single clear hero with primary CTAs (call/email/directions).
- Contact essentials surfaced without duplication; no booking form present.
- Responsive layout with semantic headings and working links; no new console errors.
