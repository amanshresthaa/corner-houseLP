# Verification Report

## DevTools Manual QA (pending)
- [ ] Console clear
- [ ] CTA buttons render two per slide; sequence cycles AB, CA, BC with distinct colors (accent for A, crimson for B, brand for C)
- [ ] Focus/keyboard checks
- [ ] Mobile/desktop view

## Automated checks
- [ ] Lint/test (not run yet)

## Notes
UI change is deterministic logic; manual QA should be run on staging with Chrome DevTools per project standard once deployed.
