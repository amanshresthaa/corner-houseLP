# Implementation Checklist

## Preparation
- [x] Confirm existing asset filenames under `src/assets/images/components/Slideshow`

## Fix
- [x] Update `components/seo/RestaurantSchema.tsx` imports to point to real asset filenames
- [ ] Align runtime asset references that still point at missing `the-the-white-horse` images

## Validation
- [x] Run `pnpm run build` to ensure the build succeeds
- [x] Note any follow-up mismatches for future cleanup

## Questions/Blockers
- None identified
