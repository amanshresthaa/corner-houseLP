The White Horse, Waterbeach: An Authoritative Brand & Operations Dossier
I. Hero & Positioning
1.1 The Waterbeach Beacon: A Revitalised Community Hub
The White Horse is positioned as a quintessential, friendly neighbourhood pub and restaurant situated in the heart of Waterbeach village, directly opposite the picturesque village green.1 Its core identity is that of a relaxed, contemporary, and welcoming establishment dedicated to preserving and invigorating the local pub spirit.3 This positioning is not merely a marketing statement but a reflection of its vital role within the community, a role underscored by local relief when it was saved from potential redevelopment into housing and revitalised by new ownership in 2025.4
The atmosphere is consistently described as warm and inviting, designed to be a perfect spot for a wide demographic. It functions as a versatile social hub, ideal for everything from a casual drink or a family meal to a lively evening gathering with friends.1 The venue's commitment to inclusivity is a cornerstone of its brand, extending a warm welcome to families and their canine companions, further cementing its status as a central and accessible community space.1
1.2 Market Proposition: A Tale of Two Pubs - The Himalayan-Cambridgeshire Fusion
The White Horse’s most compelling unique selling proposition is its innovative dual identity: it is simultaneously a traditional British village pub and an authentic Nepalese restaurant.1 This strategic fusion is the central pillar of its market positioning, allowing it to cater to distinct yet overlapping customer segments. On one hand, it serves the traditional pub-goer with a selection of classic cask ales, a familiar pub layout, and live sports broadcasts.2 On the other, it attracts culinary adventurers and local diners with an extensive and authentic menu of Nepalese cuisine.7
This business model represents a calculated and proven strategy by its parent company, Lapen Inns. In a challenging UK hospitality market where many traditional pubs are struggling to survive, simply competing on the basis of being a "pub" is a high-risk proposition.4 By introducing a niche and high-quality culinary offering, the establishment creates a powerful point of differentiation that sets it apart from regional competitors. The approach is not to erase the pub's existing identity but to enhance it. The core infrastructure that the local community values—the bar, the garden, the social atmosphere—is preserved and acts as a foundation upon which a new, exciting dining experience is built. This fusion model effectively de-risks the venture by creating two robust revenue streams: the traditional "wet-led" trade from drinkers and sports fans, and the "food-led" destination dining from those seeking a unique meal. The core brand message, therefore, is one of enhancement and evolution, respecting the pub's heritage and loyal customer base while simultaneously attracting a new and diverse clientele.
1.3 Core Values & Atmosphere
The ethos of The White Horse is defined by a set of core values that are consistently communicated and reflected in its operations.
Community-Centric: The pub is fundamentally positioned as an integral part of the Waterbeach community. The ownership group, Lapen Inns, explicitly states a commitment to creating hubs where locals feel valued and at home, not just like numbers.8 This commitment was validated by the warm reception from regulars upon the pub's reopening, who were relieved to see a cherished local institution preserved and reinvigorated.4
Family & Pet Friendly: The White Horse actively fosters a family-friendly environment.1 It is also explicitly dog-friendly, welcoming well-behaved dogs in the bar area, with a limit of two per person. Crucially, food service is available in this area, ensuring that pet owners do not have a compromised experience and can enjoy a full meal with their companions.3
Modern & Relaxed: The venue is described as having a "relaxed and contemporary setting" and "modern relaxed surroundings," indicating an interior design that is comfortable, stylish, and informal.1 This suggests a departure from a dated or overly rustic aesthetic in favour of a clean and inviting space that appeals to a modern sensibility.
Lively & Engaging: The pub cultivates a vibrant and dynamic atmosphere, primarily through the regular broadcast of live sports from major providers like Sky Sports and TNT Sports.1 This positions The White Horse as a go-to destination for sports fans, creating an engaging and energetic environment during key matches and events.

III. Story & Timeline
3.1 A New Chapter: The Lapen Inns Revival (2025)
The modern history and current identity of The White Horse were forged in early 2025. The pub was acquired by Lapen Inns, a dynamic hospitality group led by entrepreneur Subodh Gautam and his business partners Diwakar Subedi, Ravi Acharya, and Purna Man Bajrachaya.4 This acquisition marked a pivotal moment, rescuing a beloved village pub from the threat of closure and potential redevelopment—a fate that had concerned many local residents.4
The revival was swift and decisive. The White Horse officially reopened its doors on January 31, 2025, with the new, highly anticipated Nepalese menu launching shortly after on February 6, 2025.4 This relaunch was not merely a change of hands but a complete strategic repositioning. It introduced an innovative and authentic culinary concept to Waterbeach while consciously preserving the core essence of the venue as a community pub. This event represents the definitive starting point of the pub's current chapter, framing its story as one of rescue, revitalization, and culinary innovation.
3.2 Historical Context & Unanswered Questions
While the 2025 relaunch is well-documented, the pub's history prior to this is less clear from the available information. Numerous historical records exist for other pubs named "The White Horse" across the UK and internationally, but specific founding dates, a timeline of previous owners, or detailed anecdotes for the Waterbeach location are not provided.10
However, snapshots from the recent past reveal a pattern of evolution and adaptation. A blog post from April 2009 describes The White Horse as a large pub with a "huge" garden, a snooker table in the lower bar, and a menu that featured both Sunday roasts and Thai food.12 This indicates that the concept of blending traditional British pub culture with an Asian culinary offering is not entirely new to the venue, but rather a recurring theme in its history.
More recently, a detailed review from June 2023, just over six months before the Lapen Inns takeover, paints a picture of a more traditional gastropub. The menu at that time featured British and Italian-inspired dishes such as carbonara, house burgers, and BLTs, with a chef named Marcin at the helm.13 The service, delivered by staff including a praised individual named Emma, was noted as being exceptionally friendly and welcoming.13
This evidence of significant menu shifts—from Thai in 2009, to British/Italian in 2023, and now to Nepalese in 2025—demonstrates a history of reinvention. The pub has consistently adapted its offering to meet changing market demands and tastes. Therefore, the current Nepalese concept can be framed not as a radical departure, but as the latest, most ambitious chapter in the pub's ongoing story of culinary evolution. This narrative allows the brand to honor its past while championing its exciting new direction, presenting a story of a pub that has always sought to offer something special to the Waterbeach community.
IV. The Culinary Experience
The culinary program at The White Horse is its primary market differentiator, offering a unique fusion of authentic Himalayan flavours and traditional British pub fare. This dual offering is designed to satisfy a broad range of palates, from the adventurous foodie to the classic pub traditionalist.
4.1 A Taste of the Himalayas in Cambridgeshire: The Nepalese Menu
The centrepiece of the dining experience is the extensive and authentic Nepalese menu.1 Prepared using traditional recipes and authentic ingredients, the cuisine is a reflection of Nepal's diverse geography and culture, incorporating influences from neighbouring India and Tibet.4 This results in a rich and flavourful menu with dishes ranging from mild and aromatic to intensely spicy, catering to varied preferences.8 The menu is thoughtfully structured, with clear categories that guide the diner through the offerings, including Mixed Grills, Specials, Authentic Curries, Naans, Sides, and Rice.14
4.2 Signature & Speciality Dishes
Media coverage and owner interviews have highlighted several standout dishes that can be positioned as signatures of The White Horse's Nepalese offering.
Bhutuwa: Identified as the personal favourite of owner Subodh Gautam, this dish is a must-try for an authentic taste. It is characterized by a thick, flavourful sauce enriched with fried crushed garlic and crushed chilli, delivering a robust and aromatic profile. It is highly recommended to be paired with naan bread for the complete experience.5
Popular Best-Sellers: A collection of dishes have quickly emerged as customer favourites and are considered the restaurant's best-sellers. This includes the Pokhareli fish curry, Rara king prawn, Chicken rum rum, and a classic Butter chicken.5
Other Specialities: The menu also features a range of other notable dishes, including flavourful tandoori king prawns and a selection of traditional curries such as Baltis and Jalfrezis, which provide familiar yet authentic options for curry lovers.4
4.3 The British Standard: Pub Classics & Cask Ales
Crucially, The White Horse maintains its identity as a true British pub. Alongside the Nepalese specialities, the venue offers a menu of "pub classics," ensuring that traditional tastes are well catered for.5 An "English & Nepalese food menu" is explicitly mentioned, confirming this dual approach.2
This commitment to its pub heritage is most evident at the bar. The White Horse serves a selection of well-kept cask ales, a key requirement for any serious real ale establishment. The regular beers on handpump are two highly regarded classics: Greene King IPA and Timothy Taylor Landlord.2 This offering is complemented by a wide range of other beers, wines, and cocktails, providing a comprehensive beverage program to suit any occasion.1
4.4 Takeaway Service
Recognizing the modern demand for convenience and at-home dining, The White Horse offers a full takeaway service.7 This is a consistent feature across all Lapen Inns properties and serves as a vital additional revenue stream. The takeaway option allows the community to enjoy the restaurant's unique Nepalese cuisine from the comfort of their own homes, broadening the pub's market reach beyond its physical premises.15
V. Team Profiles
The success and vision of The White Horse are driven by the leadership of the Lapen Inns group and the dedication of its on-site team. Understanding the people behind the brand adds a crucial human element to its story.
5.1 The Visionaries: The Lapen Inns Leadership
The White Horse is owned and operated by Lapen Inns, a hospitality company founded by a team of passionate entrepreneurs and chefs. The leadership team includes:
Subodh Gautam: The entrepreneurial force behind the group, affectionately known as "Sub".8 A native of Nepal, Mr. Gautam arrived in the UK in 2009 with the ambition of owning a successful business. His background in hospitality and retail, fortified by a Graduate Diploma in Business Management, has been instrumental in realizing this vision.8 His philosophy is rooted in a passion for excellent customer service and a commitment to creating thriving community hubs that blend the charm of traditional British pubs with the unique flavours of his homeland.4
Ravi Acharya & Purna Man Bajrachaya: Two talented chefs who are business partners in the venture. Their culinary expertise is the foundation of the authentic Nepalese dining experience offered across the Lapen Inns portfolio.5
Diwakar Subedi: A key business partner who, alongside the others, has helped steer the group's expansion since 2022.4
The collective philosophy of Lapen Inns is to create pubs that are integral parts of their communities. They emphasize a traditional, family-friendly atmosphere, excellent quality ale, and great value food menus, all delivered by professional and friendly staff. Their mission is to run pubs where customers feel welcomed, respected, and part of a larger family.8
5.2 On-Site Team & Culinary Talent
While the Lapen Inns partners provide the strategic vision, the daily experience at The White Horse is shaped by its on-site staff. Chefs Ravi Acharya and Purna Man Bajrachaya oversee the culinary direction of the group, ensuring the authenticity and quality of the Nepalese cuisine served in Waterbeach.8
Historical reviews of the pub prior to the 2025 takeover provide a valuable benchmark for the level of service and culinary skill associated with the venue. A June 2023 review from The Cambridge Foodies gave a glowing "shout out to Emma who simply knows how good service is done," highlighting a standard of friendly, attentive, and welcoming front-of-house service.13 The same review praised the chef at the time, "Marcin," for his skill in preparing a British/Italian menu, noting that "if Marcin is on duty you're in for a treat".13
This historical praise for individual staff members underscores the importance of the on-site team in delivering the brand promise. For the new management, retaining high-performing staff through an ownership transition provides crucial continuity and helps maintain the loyalty of regular customers. If new staff have been brought in, these past reviews set a clear and high standard for the quality of service and hospitality that the community has come to expect from The White Horse.
VI. Events & Private Hire
The White Horse functions as a dynamic venue for community events and social gatherings, leveraging its versatile spaces and regular programming to maintain a lively atmosphere.
6.1 Regular Community Events
The pub hosts a number of regular events that reinforce its status as a local hub.
Quiz Night: A classic pub tradition, The White Horse holds a quiz night every Wednesday evening.2 This weekly event provides a consistent draw for regulars and encourages community engagement in a fun and competitive setting.
Live Sports: The broadcasting of major sporting events on Sky Sports and TNT Sports is a core and regular feature of the pub's offering.1 This positions The White Horse as the premier local venue for watching football, rugby, and other key fixtures, creating a vibrant and communal viewing experience.
6.2 Venue Capabilities for Private Hire
While the pub's official website does not feature a dedicated section for private hire or functions, the physical layout of the venue offers significant potential for hosting private events.7 An analysis of its structure reveals several bookable spaces suitable for a range of occasions.
Interior Spaces: The pub's split-level design provides natural separation for events.2 The upper level, which serves predominantly as the restaurant area, could be booked for private dining, celebrations, or corporate meals. The lower-level bar, with its pool table, offers a more informal setting for casual parties or gatherings. The open access between the two good-sized bars also allows for flexibility in configuring the space for larger events.
Outdoor Space: A key asset for the venue is its "large garden to the rear".2 Described in a 2009 account as "huge" and capable of easily accommodating a large group event for the Cambridge Hash House Harriers, this outdoor area is ideal for summer parties, family celebrations, wedding receptions, and community barbecues.12
The absence of explicit information on private hire packages and booking procedures on the pub's website represents a significant untapped marketing opportunity. Developing and promoting this aspect of the business could attract a new stream of revenue from birthdays, anniversaries, corporate events, and other private functions.
VII. Accessibility
Ensuring the venue is accessible to all members of the community is a key component of a welcoming pub. The White Horse provides several accessibility features, although a formal, detailed accessibility statement is not currently available.
7.1 Known Accessibility Features
Information gathered from local directories and hospitality databases confirms several key accessibility provisions.
Wheelchair Access: The pub is listed as having "Wheelchair access".1
Ramp: More specifically, a "Ramp to restaurant area" is noted, which facilitates access to the main dining space on the upper level of the split-level pub.6
Facilities: General facilities include toilets, which are essential for all guests.1 The directory also lists "Changing facilities," which is beneficial for families with young children.1
7.2 Information Gaps
While basic access is provided, there is a lack of detailed public information. The official website does not contain a dedicated accessibility page or statement that outlines the full scope of its facilities.7 Further details that would be beneficial for guests with specific needs include:
Width of doorways.
Information on step-free access to all areas, including the lower bar and the large rear garden.
The specific location and features of the accessible toilet.
Provisions for guests with visual or hearing impairments, such as large-print menus or a hearing loop system.
Providing this detailed information publicly would enhance the pub's reputation for inclusivity and allow potential guests to plan their visit with confidence.
VIII. Press & Accolades
The relaunch of The White Horse in early 2025 generated positive local media attention, effectively communicating the new vision for the pub and creating a narrative of community-focused revitalization.
8.1 Relaunch Coverage (February 2025)
The pub's reopening under Lapen Inns was featured in prominent local publications, including the Ely Standard and Cambridge News.4 This coverage was crucial in shaping the public perception of the new venture and generated significant goodwill.
The key messages consistently amplified across these articles included:
The New Ownership: Introducing Subodh Gautam and the Lapen Inns team as the new custodians of the pub.4
The Culinary Vision: Highlighting the unique and exciting introduction of an authentic Nepalese menu to the village of Waterbeach.5
A Community Mission: Emphasizing the owners' mission to "keep the pub alive" and prevent a valued local asset from being lost to redevelopment.4
Positive Local Reception: Reporting on the enthusiastic and welcoming reaction from local residents and regulars, who were excited about both the preservation of the pub and its innovative new menu.4
Signature Dishes: Showcasing specific menu items to entice potential diners, such as the owner's favourite Bhutuwa, as well as Pokhareli fish curry and tandoori king prawns.4
This press coverage provided a powerful third-party endorsement of the new concept and established a positive and compelling story for the brand from its inception.
8.2 Accolades & Awards
At present, there is no information available regarding any specific awards or accolades received by The White Horse since its relaunch in February 2025. As the new management team establishes its reputation for culinary excellence and community engagement, pursuing industry awards and recognition from food guides should be a key objective for future public relations and marketing efforts.
IX. Social Proof & Reviews
Customer feedback and public perception are critical indicators of a hospitality venue's success. For The White Horse, social proof comes from both direct media reporting and independent reviews, which, when contextualized, paint a picture of a well-regarded establishment.
9.1 Community Reception (Post-Relaunch)
The most powerful social proof following the 2025 takeover is the positive community reaction detailed in local press. Statements from owner Subodh Gautam, such as "the locals were more excited than I am" because they feared the pub would be turned into flats, and his observation that upon opening, "the regulars turned up and they were all very welcoming," serve as strong testimonials.4 This immediate buy-in from the existing customer base demonstrates a high level of goodwill and trust in the new venture.
9.2 Third-Party Reviews (Pre-Relaunch Context)
While reviews from before February 2025 reflect previous management and menus, they establish a historical benchmark for quality and atmosphere that is relevant to the pub's enduring reputation.
The Cambridge Foodies (June 2023): This highly positive review described The White Horse as a "little gem".13 It praised the venue for being "very welcoming with friendly and attentive staff," singling out an employee named Emma for her exceptional service. The food, under chef Marcin, was also commended for its quality and value. The review highlighted the "very nice" garden, ample parking, and the fact that guests felt welcome to stay as long as they liked, contributing to a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere.13 This review sets a high standard for the customer experience that the new management can aim to uphold and exceed.
The Endless British Pub Crawl (April 2009): This much older review provides a long-term perspective on the pub's core attributes. Even then, it was noted for its "really friendly" staff, "huge" garden, convenient location, and "plentiful and properly attended" beer taps.12 This demonstrates that the pub's reputation for friendliness and its excellent garden are long-standing features that are central to its identity.
9.3 Social Media Presence
A review of the available materials indicates a significant gap in the pub's digital footprint. There are no direct links to official, active social media profiles (such as Facebook or Instagram) for either The White Horse in Waterbeach or its parent company, Lapen Inns.9 In the modern hospitality landscape, a strong social media presence is essential for direct customer engagement, promotion of events and specials, and the showcasing of the venue's atmosphere and culinary offerings. Establishing and maintaining active social media channels should be considered a critical priority for the brand's marketing strategy.
X. Neighbourhood Guide: The Best of Waterbeach & Beyond
The White Horse is perfectly situated to serve as a welcoming hub for visitors exploring the rich history and natural beauty of Waterbeach and its surroundings. Its location in the heart of the village makes it an ideal starting point, stop-off, or final destination for a day of local discovery.
10.1 In The Village: Waterbeach
The pub itself is a village landmark, located centrally on Greenside, opposite the village green.1 This prime position makes it an easily accessible and recognizable destination for both locals and visitors, embedding it directly into the fabric of village life.
10.2 Local Attraction: Denny Abbey & The Farmland Museum
Just a short drive from the pub lies one of the area's premier attractions, Denny Abbey and The Farmland Museum.16 This historic site offers a captivating journey through over 850 years of local history.
What to Do: Visitors can explore the magnificent Denny Abbey, a former Benedictine monastery founded in the 12th century that later housed Knights Templars and Franciscan nuns.17 The adjoining Farmland Museum tells the story of rural Cambridgeshire life through interactive displays, an extensive collection of historic farming machinery, reconstructed workshops for blacksmiths and wheelwrights, and a charming 1940s village shop display.16 The site also features a children's play area with a real tractor, making it an excellent family destination.19
Visitor Information: The attraction is located on Ely Road, Waterbeach, CB25 9PQ. It is open from late March to late October, typically from Thursday to Sunday and on Bank Holiday Mondays. Ample free parking is available on-site. Facilities include the Docky Box Café for refreshments and a gift shop.19
Strategic Link: The White Horse is the perfect venue for a pre-visit coffee or a post-visit lunch or dinner, offering a relaxing and satisfying conclusion to a day spent exploring local history.
10.3 Natural Escape (1): Waterbeach Lake
For those seeking outdoor activity, the new Waterbeach Lake development provides a beautiful setting for recreation and relaxation.21
What to Do: The main feature is a scenic 1.2km lake loop trail, perfect for walking, running, and cycling.22 The lake itself is a hub for watersports, with pre-booked activities managed by the Cambridge Sport Lakes Trust. These include open-water swimming and paddleboarding sessions held during the spring and summer months.22
Visitor Information: The lake is accessible on foot or by bicycle from Denny End Road. For those arriving by car, parking is available at the designated transport hub just off the A10 roundabout. A lakeside café is open seven days a week from 9am to 5pm, offering food, drinks, and ice cream.24
Strategic Link: After an invigorating swim or a peaceful walk around the lake, The White Horse offers a warm and welcoming spot to refuel with a hearty Nepalese meal or relax with a well-earned drink.
10.4 Natural Escape (2): Milton Country Park
A short distance away is the expansive Milton Country Park, a 95-acre oasis created from former gravel pits.25
What to Do: The park boasts a varied natural habitat with woodlands, lakes, and a network of attractive pathways suitable for walking, cycling, pushchairs, and wheelchairs.25 It is exceptionally family-friendly, with two children's playgrounds, and offers a wide range of bookable activities, including paddleboarding, kayaking, fishing, and open-water swimming.26 The park is also very popular with dog owners, featuring designated off-lead areas and even a convenient dog-wash station.25
Visitor Information: The park is located on Cambridge Road, Milton, CB24 6AZ. While the park grounds are accessible year-round, the car park and on-site facilities (including a café and visitor centre) have seasonal opening hours. Parking charges apply and are a key source of funding for the park's upkeep.26
Strategic Link: As the managing body for activities at Waterbeach Lake, Milton Country Park is directly connected to the local area's recreational scene. The White Horse can appeal to visitors of both parks, positioning itself as the premier dining destination for anyone enjoying a day out in the area's beautiful green spaces.
XI. Imagery
A strong visual identity is paramount for any modern hospitality brand. High-quality imagery is needed to convey the unique atmosphere, culinary excellence, and welcoming nature of The White Horse.
11.1 Current State of Visual Assets
An assessment of the pub's current online presence reveals a significant lack of professional visual assets. The official website does not feature a dedicated photo gallery or virtual tour, limiting its ability to visually engage potential customers.7 While some external photographs of the building exist on third-party sites like Visit South Cambs and CAMRA, these are often functional rather than aspirational.1 There is a clear and pressing need for a comprehensive library of high-quality, professional images that accurately and attractively represent the brand.
11.2 Strategic Recommendations for Photography
To build a powerful visual brand, a professional photoshoot should be commissioned with a detailed and strategic shot list. This will create a versatile asset library for use across the website, social media, press materials, and online booking platforms. The photoshoot should aim to capture the full essence of The White Horse experience.
The recommended shot list should include:
Vibrant Food Photography: High-resolution, artfully styled images of the signature Nepalese dishes. Shots should emphasize the vibrant colours, fresh ingredients, and beautiful presentation to create an irresistible visual appeal. Close-ups of textures and wider shots of plated meals are essential.
Traditional Pub Atmosphere: Warm and inviting photographs of the interior spaces. This should include shots of the main bar with the cask ale hand-pulls in focus, the comfortable seating areas, the split-level layout, and any charming architectural details. If a fireplace exists, it should be a focal point in cosy, atmospheric shots.
Lively Social Scenes: Candid and staged photographs of guests genuinely enjoying the pub. This could include groups of friends watching a sports match, families dining together, couples enjoying a drink, and participants engaging in the weekly quiz night. These images should convey energy, community, and enjoyment.
The Expansive Garden: Professional shots of the large rear garden are critical. Images should showcase its scale and potential, featuring guests socialising at picnic tables on a sunny day. The photography should position the garden as a major selling point for the summer months.
The Welcoming Team: Professional yet approachable portraits of the key on-site team members, and potentially the Lapen Inns owners. Putting a face to the brand helps to humanize it and reinforces the message of a friendly, welcoming establishment.
