# Implementation Plan: Homepage Design System Doc

## Objective

Create a Markdown reference capturing the homepage’s current design system so other pages can reuse layout, palette, and component patterns.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] New `.md` file describing global foundations and each section pattern.
- [ ] Includes actionable details (spacing, colors, component references).
- [ ] Linked to actual component paths.

## Steps

1. Outline doc structure (Overview, Layout/Spacing, Color rhythm, Components per section).
2. Extract specifics from components (class names, gradients, spacing) and summarize in friendly prose.
3. Write Markdown under `docs/homepage-design-system.md` (or similar) with headings and bullet points for quick reuse.
4. Cross-check content for accuracy vs source files.

## Testing Strategy

- No runtime behavior; basic content verification only.
