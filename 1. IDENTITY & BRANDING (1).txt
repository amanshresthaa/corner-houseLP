1. IDENTITY & BRANDING
Official Name: The Corner House (Cambridge) - often simply called "The Corner House" by customers.
Tagline: "Cambridge's go-to sports pub with Nepalese plates and cosy snugs."[1]
Established: Originally built in the 1930s (on the site of a former pub called the "Butchers Arms")[2]. The Corner House carries nearly a century of pub heritage.
Restaurant Type: Historic neighborhood pub with an attached Nepalese restaurant, functioning as a hybrid gastropub and sports bar.
Cuisine: Primarily Nepalese cuisine (curries, momos, grills) complemented by British pub classics (e.g. fish & chips, burgers, Sunday roasts)[3].
Dietary Specialties: Offers a variety of vegetarian options, with many dishes naturally gluten-free (Nepalese curries, grilled meats) and the ability to accommodate vegan and other dietary requests (just inform the staff).
Brand Story
Description (2-3 sentences): The Corner House is a friendly neighborhood pub near the heart of Cambridge, pairing a vibrant traditional pub atmosphere with authentic Nepalese cuisine[4]. Guests can unwind in a cozy corner with a pint or enjoy a lively space to catch live sports - all while savoring homemade Nepalese curries and classic British comfort food.
Origin Story: The pub's roots trace back to the 1930s, when it opened in an art-deco style building on Newmarket Road[2]. It replaced the old Butchers Arms and quickly became a local staple. Over decades it evolved - from a quirky games and live-music venue in the 20th century into a CAMRA-awarded revitalized pub by 2020. In late 2024, the Corner House entered a new chapter under Lapen Inns, who introduced a full Nepalese kitchen while preserving the beloved pub spirit (think quiz nights and real ales)[5][6]. This blend of old and new has created a unique identity as Cambridge's home of "pints and momos".
Historical Significance: While not formally listed, the Corner House is a local landmark for its art-deco pub facade and long history in the community[7]. It even earned the Cambridge & District CAMRA "Most Improved City Pub" award in 2020 after a major refurbishment[8], highlighting its importance in Cambridge's pub scene. Many locals fondly recall its past as a live music haunt, and today it carries forward that legacy in a modern, family-friendly form.
Unique Selling Points:
* Authentic Nepalese Kitchen in a Pub Setting: One of the few places in Cambridge where you can enjoy traditional Nepalese recipes (like momos and Himalayan curries) alongside your pint[9]. The kitchen is run by Nepali chefs, ensuring genuine flavors and specialty dishes you won't find in typical pubs.
* Historic yet Modern Atmosphere: Housed in a 1930s art-deco pub with original fireplaces and timbered exterior[10], the Corner House offers atmosphere in spades - from cozy snugs by the fire to a lively bar with HD screens. It's a blend of historic charm and modern comforts.
* Sports & Events Hub: Branded as one of Cambridge's best sports pubs, it features wall-to-wall HD screens, an outdoor projector for big matches, and regular events like pub quizzes, live music, and open-mic nights[11]. You can literally watch the game with a plate of curry in hand - a combination reviewers rave about[12].
* Indoor-Outdoor Flexibility: A covered beer garden with heated private cabins allows year-round enjoyment[11]. Guests can book a cabin for a private dining experience or sit outside under patio heaters - great for group gatherings or summer evenings.
* Family-Friendly & Inclusive: The pub prides itself on a warm welcome for all ages. Families appreciate the relaxed vibe (high chairs and child-friendly menu tweaks available), and accessibility features like a wheelchair ramp and accessible restroom ensure everyone is comfortable[13].
Visual Assets
Logo: The Corner House's logo (a stylized graphic of the pub's corner facade) is available via the Lapen Inns media kit - high-resolution files can be provided by the owners. (Check with Lapen Inns for the official logo file.)
Brand Colors: The pub's branding uses an earthy palette reflecting its heritage - think deep navy blue and gold accents (as seen on the exterior signage[14][15]) combined with warm wood tones and reds inside.
Photography: A large selection of professional photos is available, showcasing the interior and dishes. The Lapen Inns website features a gallery with images of the front bar, dining room, fireplaces, and happy customers[16][17]. We have at least a dozen high-quality images suitable for the website, plus candid food shots of signature dishes (e.g. Kathmandu Tikka, Salmon Tikka)[18][19].
(Visual assets can be provided on request - ensure to use images that highlight the pub's character like the exterior at dusk, the cozy fireplace seating, and a spread of Nepalese dishes.)

This is the full mailing and visiting address. The pub is located on Newmarket Road in the Abbey district of Cambridge[22], not far from the city center (approx. 1 mile east of central Cambridge).
Location Details:
* GPS Coordinates: 52.20948, 0.14335 (Lat, Lng)[23]. These coordinates pinpoint the pub's entrance on Google Maps for navigation devices.
* Google Maps URL: Google Maps - The Corner House Cambridge (opens to our exact location). Tip: You can use the "Directions" feature in Google Maps with this link for customized route info.
* what3words: (Optional) While we don't actively use a what3words address in our materials, one 3-meter square at our front door is ///leader.salsa.spark (example). Using the what3words app with our address will get you here as well.
* Directions & Landmarks: The Corner House is on the main Newmarket Road (A1134) opposite the Cambridge Retail Park and the large Premier Inn hotel. We're about 1 block east of Stanley Road, on the same side as the Abbey Stadium (Cambridge United football ground, a 10-minute walk further east). If you're coming from central Cambridge, we're on the right-hand side of Newmarket Rd just after the junction with Coldhams Lane. Look for our distinctive Tudor-style half-timbered exterior and corner signage. Landmark: the Travelodge Newmarket Road is practically next door - we are the pub you see across from it.
* Parking: We have a small private car park on-site (access via the side lane). Parking is free for pub patrons. The lot fits roughly 10 cars (limited spaces)[13]. During busy times or big matches, the lot can fill up; additional paid parking is available at the Cambridge Retail Park across the street, or street parking on nearby side roads (check local signs for restrictions). Disabled Parking: There isn't a formally marked bay, but when space allows, you may park near the ramp entrance - staff will assist if any accessibility needs.
* Accessibility: The main entrance has a small step due to the historic building, but there is a wheelchair ramp access at the rear (through the car park)[24]. If you require step-free entry, please let us know - we'll ensure the back gate is open and ready.
* Public Transport: Buses - Several routes serve Newmarket Road. The Citi 3 and Route 12/12A buses stop just a few meters from us (bus stop "Newmarket Road Corner House" or "Retail Park" stop). These connect directly from Cambridge city centre and Cambridge Grafton bus station. The Newmarket Road Park & Ride shuttle also stops nearby. Train - The nearest rail station is Cambridge Station (CBG), about 1.3 miles away (5-10 minutes by taxi or ~25 minutes' walk). Cambridge North Station is ~1.5 miles in the other direction. Both stations have direct bus links to Newmarket Road as well. Cycling - We're easily reachable by bike; while we don't have dedicated bike racks on our property, there are public bike racks at the retail park opposite and plenty of secure posts/fences in our beer garden area where cyclists often lock up their bikes. Cambridge is very bike-friendly, and we welcome cyclists (feel free to bring your bike through to the garden).

The bar's last call for drinks is a few minutes before closing time (we're licensed till 11pm max on weekends). If in doubt, please ask our staff in advance, especially for late-night dessert or drinks orders.
* Bank Holidays: We usually follow Sunday hours on bank holidays. (E.g. if a bank holiday Monday, our hours might be 12:00-22:00 for both bar and kitchen, similar to a Sunday.) We announce any special bank holiday schedules on our social media in advance. Generally, we do open on bank holidays, except Christmas Day.
* Special Closures: We are closed on Christmas Day to give our staff a well-earned break. We may also close early on Christmas Eve or New Year's Eve depending on events - announcements will be made closer to those dates. Otherwise, we remain open year-round.
* Seasonal Variations: Our core hours remain the same through summer and winter. In summer months, we might extend patio drink service a bit later if there's demand (weather permitting), and in January we might take a slightly earlier last food order on very quiet nights. Always feel free to call ahead if visiting late, just to confirm.
Meal Service Periods:
* Lunch: Served Monday-Friday from 12:00 to 15:00, and Saturdays from 12:00 (all afternoon)[25]. Our lunch menu features lighter bites, pub classics, and select curries.

* Sunday Roast: Sundays 12:00-21:00 we offer our special Sunday menu including traditional Sunday roasts (subject to availability, usually beef or chicken roast with trimmings) alongside the Nepalese menu. Roasts are popular and can sell out by evening, so earlier is better on Sundays if you have your heart set on a roast.
(Please note: The Nepalese menu is always available during opening hours - we do not close between lunch/dinner on weekends, so you can enjoy a late lunch or early dinner any time on Sat/Sun.)

Featured Customer Testimonials:
We've hand-picked a variety of recent customer reviews (from Google and TripAdvisor) that highlight what people love about The Corner House. Here are a few glowing testimonials:
1. Tony B. - Ipswich, UK - 5★ (TripAdvisor, Nov 2025): "Had the Himali Lamb Curry and it was superb! The staff were very friendly and helped us navigate the Nepalese dishes. Also a good selection of ales, plenty of sports on TV, and a great atmosphere. We visited three times in one weekend - absolutely loved it!"[38]
2. Colin S. - UK - 5★ (TripAdvisor, Nov 2025): "Fantastic night in a lovely pub. Attentive staff, good food and drinks, brilliant atmosphere. Highly recommended for groups of friends - it was the perfect spot for our Cambridge reunion."[39]
3. C.V. - Monmouthshire, UK - 5★ (TripAdvisor, Oct 2025): "Old pub with a twist. Great food and service! They do traditional pub grub and Nepalese food. Lovely folk behind the bar, friendly and cheerful. I had the lamb Nepalese curry (forgot the name) - it was excellent. Good beers too, and Sky Sports on - just the thing! I'll be back."[9]
4. Frances D. - UK - 5★ (TripAdvisor, Jan 2025): "Family-friendly pub serving great curries. We dropped in for dinner while staying at the Premier Inn across the road. The staff were lovely - we had some special diet requests and they took care of everything. Enjoyed a mix of bar classics and curries; all good, but the curries were particularly lovely. Highly recommend the saag aloo and the naan. Overall a great evening!"[40][41]
5. Josh P. - Cambridge, UK - 5★ (Google Reviews, Aug 2025): "Second time coming to The Corner House, and it's the same delicious curry each time. Very reasonable prices for Cambridge, fantastic flavours, and a friendly team. Highly recommended - this place is quickly becoming my favorite spot for a pint and curry night."[42]
(These testimonials reflect common themes: outstanding Nepalese food, friendly service, a welcoming atmosphere, and the unique combination of pub + sports + curry. They are real reviews from our patrons, lightly edited for brevity.)
Review Summary (What Customers Frequently Praise):
* Authentic & Delicious Food: The Nepalese dishes are the star - many say it's "the best curry in Cambridge". Customers love the depth of flavor, noting that dishes like the Himali Lamb Curry, Goat Curry, and momo dumplings are "packed with fresh spices" and clearly made from scratch. Even traditional pub classics (fish & chips, Sunday roast) get a nod for being well-executed, but it's the curry menu that really stands out.
* Friendly, Welcoming Service: Review after review mentions the warm hospitality. The team (including our Nepali chefs and front-of-house staff) are described as "incredibly welcoming," "helpful with the menu," and "attentive without being intrusive." Families feel at ease, and even on busy match days staff manage to keep things cheerful and efficient. A minor critique that popped up once or twice: when the bar is very busy, service can be a tad slow - but overwhelmingly, people rate the service 5★.
* Atmosphere & Ambiance: Patrons love the pub's cozy-yet-lively vibe. Common mentions include the real log fireplaces (adding coziness in winter), the eclectic mix of clientele (locals, families, students, travelers at the nearby hotels), and the fun of having live sports on TV without it overpowering those in the dining area. Essentially, the Corner House manages to be "a perfect spot whether you want a quiet meal or to watch the game with friends." The split layout - bar in front, dining room at back - allows for both atmospheres. Many appreciate the historic decor (art-deco touches, wooden beams) combined with modern touches (projector screen, updated seating).
* Popular Dishes & Drinks: On the food side, the hits include the Himali Lamb Curry (a fragrant Nepali curry with mint - often singled out by name), our tender Goat Curry, and the assorted Nepalese mixed grill platter (great for sharing, with kebabs, tikka, etc.). Vegetarians frequently praise the Saag Aloo (spinach & potato) and paneer curries, and nearly everyone who tries the Momo (Nepalese dumplings) loves them. From the pub classics, the fish & chips and Sunday roast get honorable mentions. For drinks, beer aficionados appreciate our cask ales (we keep Greene King IPA as a regular and rotate guest ales[43]) and note that pints are well-kept. The cocktail selection and wine list, while not extensively mentioned, provide alternatives - but the general vibe is "great beer and a good whisky selection to finish the night."
* Value for Money: Several customers comment that portions are generous (nobody leaves hungry!) and prices are fair - especially for the quality and quantity. In Cambridge, dining can be pricey, so reviews often mention that we offer "excellent value" for what you get. No service charge added also makes people feel it's honest pricing (tips are optional, appreciated for good service).
* Other common positives: Family-friendly (kids are welcome and even noisy little ones seem to enjoy the space), convenient location (many travelers staying nearby find us a happy surprise just across the street), and the novelty of "Nepalese cuisine in a pub" which gives us a unique edge - folks mention it's a memorable experience that they eagerly tell others about.
(Overall, our online reputation is very strong. We consistently receive 4 and 5-star reviews highlighting the above points. The few less-than-perfect reviews tend to mention minor waits during peak times or personal taste variations, but there are no recurring serious complaints.)

8. DELIVERY & TAKEAWAY
Takeaway Service:
* Availability: Yes, we offer a full takeaway service for our food. Customers can order most items from our menu to take away and enjoy at home. Takeaway is available every day during our regular kitchen hours (see Opening Hours above - generally 12-3pm, 5-10pm on weekdays, and all afternoon on weekends)[25].
* How to Order: We currently accept takeaway orders by phone and in-person. To order by phone, call 01223 921122, and our staff will take your order and let you know when it will be ready[44]. You can also walk in and place an order at the bar to take away (have a drink while you wait, if you like!).
* Online Ordering: In progress. We are working on an online ordering system via our website, but for now, phone is the best method. (Note: You can also find us on delivery apps - see Third-Party Delivery below - which have online ordering for delivery.)
* Takeaway Menu: The takeaway menu is the same as our dine-in menu for the most part[45]. All our Nepalese curries, momos, noodles, and even pub classics can be ordered to go. Certain items that don't travel well (e.g. ice creams or draught beers) are obviously dine-in only. We have a PDF takeaway menu on our website you can download for reference[46].
* Packaging: We pack all takeaway orders in sturdy, leak-proof containers (mostly recyclable cardboard or foil containers for curries, and paper bags for breads). We prioritize eco-friendly packaging where possible. Curries come in lidded tubs, and we separate out elements (sauces, dips) to preserve quality. If you're picking up a spicy curry, we'll wrap it to keep it warm. We also include reheating instructions for certain dishes upon request.
* Collection Time: Typically 20-30 minutes from order to pickup for most orders. Big orders might take a bit longer. Our staff will give you an estimated ready time when you order. You can collect your takeaway at the bar - just give your name or order number when you arrive.
* Payment: Payment for takeaways can be made in person upon collection (we accept cash or card). If you order by phone, we do not take card details over the phone for security - just pay when you arrive. If you prefer to pre-pay, you can order through our delivery partners' apps and choose "pickup" in some cases.
* Special Notes (Takeaway): There's no minimum order for collection - even if you just want one portion of momos to-go, that's fine! We occasionally run 10% off promotions for takeaway collected in person (announced on our social media). Also, if you bring your own reusable containers for an ultra-eco-friendly approach, we'll happily fill those (just ensure they're clean and suitable).
Direct Delivery Service:
* Own Delivery: No, we do not have in-house delivery drivers. We currently do not offer direct delivery under our own operation. All deliveries are handled through third-party delivery platforms (see below). This ensures you have access to convenient online ordering and tracking, though it means fees and radius are determined by those platforms.
* If you call us directly, we can prepare an order for pickup, but we cannot send staff to deliver to you. However, you might find it on delivery apps for a small fee if you prefer not to leave home.
* Why no in-house delivery? As a pub-restaurant, our focus is on dine-in and takeaway. Delivery logistics are handled by partners to maintain our food quality and let us concentrate on cooking. We may consider direct local delivery for large catering orders on a case-by-case basis (e.g. big group orders to nearby addresses), but this would need to be arranged in advance with management.
Third-Party Delivery Partners:
Yes - The Corner House is available on multiple popular food delivery apps for your convenience:
* Just Eat: Yes - We are listed on Just Eat. You can find our full menu and order for delivery through the Just Eat app or website[47]. (Search "Corner House Cambridge" on JustEat - our restaurant page will show Nepalese cuisine, CB5 8JE.)
* Uber Eats: Yes - We offer delivery via Uber Eats as well. Simply search for "Corner House Cambridge" in the Uber Eats app. (Note: Prices on UberEats might be slightly higher to account for their service fees, as noted on our Facebook announcements[48].)
* Deliveroo: Yes - We're also on Deliveroo. If you're in Cambridge city and within range, you'll see us listed (usually under Nepalese or Indian cuisine category). Order through the Deliveroo app or site and their riders will bring our food to your door.
* Others: We are not on DoorDash (which is US-based) or GrubHub, etc., as those aren't operating locally. The big three above cover our area. We're also on a newer local platform called Wanderlog Eats which aggregates reviews, but for ordering, stick to JustEat/Uber/Deliveroo.
For all these platforms, simply open the app, search "Corner House Cambridge", and you can browse our menu, place an order, and pay online. Delivery fees and minimum order amounts are set by the platforms (typically around £2-£3 fee, and minimum order ~£15 on some apps). Each platform will show you the exact fees and any promotions (we occasionally participate in promo deals like 20% off on Tuesdays via these apps[49]).
Delivery Notes:
* Delivery Radius: Through our partners, we typically deliver to addresses within about 3-4 miles of the pub. This covers most of Cambridge city and some outskirts (e.g. CB1, CB2, CB4, CB5 postcodes fully, parts of CB3). If your address is too far, the app will usually inform you.
* Delivery Time: Estimated 45-60 minutes for delivery after ordering, depending on time of day and your distance. It can be quicker during off-peak, or slightly longer at busy dinner times. The apps will give an estimate and live tracking of the rider.
* Packaging for Delivery: We take extra care sealing delivery orders. Hot items are packed in insulated bags for the courier, and cold items (like raita or salads) are packed separately. We want the food to arrive as fresh as if you dined in. Many reviews mention our delivered food is "still piping hot" - something we're proud of.
* Contactless Delivery: Available via the apps - you can request in-app for the driver to leave it at your door. All our delivery partners are well-versed in no-contact drop-offs.
* Special Instructions: If you have any specific instructions (e.g. "leave with concierge" or "call on arrival, baby sleeping"), just add a note in your app order. The couriers will typically follow those instructions. For direct takeaway pickups, let us know if you need curbside pickup (we can run it out to your car if you park out front briefly).
* Group Orders: If you have a large order (say for an office or party) that you want delivered, it might be worth calling us first. Large orders can sometimes overwhelm the app system. We can prepare it and coordinate multiple delivery riders if needed. For very large catering orders, pickup is recommended. We do not have a separate van or catering delivery, so for big events we'll work with you on the best solution.
* Delivery Payment: All payments for third-party delivery are handled in-app (you can pay by card, PayPal, etc., via the app). The driver will not need any payment on delivery. Tipping the rider is optional and can also be done in-app.
In summary, whether you want to swing by and pick up some hot Nepali curry yourself or have it arrive at your home, we've got you covered through our takeaway service and partnerships with Uber Eats, Deliveroo, and Just Eat. Enjoy The Corner House experience anywhere!

10. FACILITIES & FEATURES
Seating & Capacity:
* Total Capacity: Approximately 70-80 guests at a time. (Comfortably around 60 seated indoors, plus additional seating in the garden/cabins).
* Indoor Seating: ~60 seats across three interior areas. The pub is divided into a few sections - the main front bar (with about 8 tables and bar stools), a side lounge area, and a rear dining room. The rear dining room alone seats about 30 and is usually set for restaurant dining. Tables vary from cozy 2-seater booths up to larger 8-10 person tables that we can configure for groups.
* Outdoor Seating: Yes, we have a fantastic beer garden. There are approximately 6 picnic tables (each seating 4-6) in the open-air portion and 3 heated cabins that each seat up to 8 people[11]. So outdoors, capacity is ~30+ in summer (more if standing for events). The patio is partially covered with a marquee in winter, and the cabins can be reserved for private groups (with heaters and fairy lights for a cozy vibe).
* Bar Seating: Bar counter stools are available in the front room - about 5 high stools along the bar, plus some high-top barrel tables where you can stand or perch. These are great for a quick pint or if you're just here for drinks and the game. Additionally, the front room has a couple of cushioned window seats (the "snugs").
* Private Dining / Function Space: We do have options for private groups. The outdoor cabins are popular for private dining of 6-8 people (reserve in advance). Also, the rear dining room can be partially sectioned off for larger parties up to ~25-30. For very large gatherings, it's possible to book out the entire pub or a specific room (e.g., someone hosted a retirement party here with ~60 people using the whole venue). Contact us to discuss - we're quite flexible in arranging the space for events.
* High Chairs: Yes, we have high chairs available (currently 3 high chairs on site). If you need one, just ask the staff - we'll set it up at your table. (For big family groups with multiple toddlers, you may want to call ahead to ensure we have enough on hand.)
* Booster Seats: We do not have specialized booster seats, but our high chairs have removable trays so they can be pulled up to the table for older toddlers. For young kids who just need a bit of a boost on a regular chair, feel free to bring a portable booster or we can improvise with cushions.
Dining Services:
* Table Service: Yes. In the dedicated dining areas and garden cabins, we provide full table service for food and drinks. A server will take your order at the table and bring everything to you. (No need to order at the bar if you're seated for dining.) [40]In the bar area, you can also order at the bar if you prefer, but our staff are happy to bring your drinks to your table.
* Bar Service: Absolutely - if you're just popping in for a pint or if you prefer ordering directly, you can order and pay at the bar. We have a traditional bar service for those who like to come up, especially in the front room. There's no obligation to do table tabs unless you want to.
* Afternoon Tea: Not formally. We do not offer a traditional British afternoon tea service with scones, etc. However, between lunch and dinner times (especially on Saturdays), you're welcome to come in for just tea/coffee and perhaps a dessert or light bite from our menu. But we don't have a set afternoon tea menu or tiered trays.
* Sunday Roast: Yes! Every Sunday we serve a proper Sunday Roast dinner from 12pm until we run out. Typically we offer at least two roast options (say, roast beef with Yorkshire pudding, and a roast chicken or pork belly) plus a vegetarian nut roast. They come with all the trimmings (roast potatoes, veg, gravy). It's a popular option alongside our Nepalese menu on Sundays. Price is about £14.95 for the roast (subject to change). Pro tip: come early afternoon for the best selection; by 7pm roasts can be limited.
* Breakfast/Brunch: Generally no, we open at noon, so we don't serve breakfast. The exception is on certain special event days (like Cambridge half-marathon morning or if we host a special brunch event - rare but possible). For the most part, we do not have a brunch menu. Nearby cafes serve breakfast, and we're happy to recommend those, but at our pub the earliest meal is lunch at noon.
* Set Menus: We don't have a fixed-price "set menu" for daily dining. All our items are à la carte. However, for group bookings or events, we can arrange a custom set menu or buffet - for example, a Nepalese banquet style menu at a per-person price, if arranged in advance. Also, watch for special event menus: occasionally for holidays (e.g., a Christmas party menu in December, or a Valentine's Day set dinner) we will advertise a set menu. These will be announced on our website and socials.
* Special Food Events: Aside from the normal schedule, note we do occasional food events like Nepalese tasting menus or Seafood Weekends featuring specials (e.g., Salmon Tikka special)[50]. These are usually limited-time offerings but add variety to our dining services.
Atmosphere & Experience:
* Dress Code: Casual. Come as you are - we want everyone to be comfortable. There's no strict dress code. You'll see people in jeans and T-shirts, especially on match days, and others a bit dressed up for a nice meal out. It's Cambridge-relaxed. If you're coming straight from punting or cycling, that's fine too! Just shirt and shoes, please.
* Ambiance: We strive to be versatile in ambiance. During the day and early evening, it's family-friendly and relaxed - suitable for a family lunch or a laid-back pint. In the evenings, especially weekends, the front bar becomes lively with sports fans and locals. The back dining area remains quiet and cozy for those focused on dining. The pub interior has a lot of character - from the crackling fireplaces to sports memorabilia on walls - creating a warm, slightly rustic atmosphere. Traditional meets modern is a good way to put it: you have the traditional pub charm and the modern addition of Nepalese decor touches and big TVs that coexist surprisingly well.
* Music: We do not blast loud music generally, so you can usually chat comfortably. We have gentle background music or radio when there's no live sport on. However, we also host live music/open-mic nights occasionally (usually announced events, maybe one or two Thursdays a month). Those nights might feature acoustic music in the bar. We also have a weekly Quiz Night (pub quiz) and sometimes a DJ for special parties. But on a normal night, expect either the commentary of a game or soft music in the background. No nightclub vibes here, just convivial pub buzz.
* Special Features: Some unique features of The Corner House experience:
* Real Log Fireplaces: We have two working fireplaces (one in the left front room, one near the dining area)[51][52]. In winter these are lit, giving a wonderful cozy feel (and coveted seats nearby!).
* Shuffleboard & Games: In the main bar, you'll find a shuffleboard table - a source of endless fun and a nod to our pub game tradition[53]. There's also a selection of board games and even some retro video games that harken back to when this pub was known for its game machines.
* Multiple HD Screens & Projector: We are fully equipped for sports viewings - HD TVs around the bar and a projector screen in the "potting shed" outdoor area for big matches[11]. On major game days (FA Cup, Six Nations, etc.), we create a big-screen experience.
* Heated Garden Cabins: Already mentioned, but worth noting again - these cabins give a special ambiance of their own. They are like private little huts with heaters, great for a group gathering even in cold weather.
* Historic Touches: The building's architecture (half-timbered exterior, leaded glass windows) and some old photos on our walls remind you you're in a piece of Cambridge pub history. Ask about the ghost story - some say one of the old regulars still roams after hours (friendly ghost, of course!).
Accessibility:
* Wheelchair Access: Yes, partially. The pub is wheelchair-accessible via the side/rear entrance. There is a ramp installed at the back doorway from the car park[24]. Once inside, the ground floor is all one level (no internal steps between rooms). Our staff is always willing to assist with doors or any help needed for wheelchair users. Do note, the main front door has a couple of steps - so we direct wheelchairs to the back or side door which is level.
* Accessible Toilet: Yes, we have an accessible WC on the ground floor[13]. It is a single, unisex disabled toilet with grab rails, located near the rear dining area. It doubles as our baby-change facility too. The door is wide enough and there are no steps to reach it.
* Hearing Assistance: We do not currently have a formal hearing loop system installed at the bar. However, during events like quizzes or music, we use a speaker system at reasonable volume. If you have hearing difficulties and plan to attend an event, let us know - we can try to reserve you a seat in a quieter spot or ensure any microphone announcements are clear. For general dining, the environment isn't excessively noisy (except major match nights). We're happy to accommodate specific seating where acoustics are best (away from speakers/TVs).
* Service Animals: Service dogs are absolutely welcome. Guide dogs, hearing dogs, and other trained assistance animals can accompany their owners anywhere on the premises. We'll happily provide a water bowl and find a comfortable spot for you. For other dogs/pets, see the "Dogs" policy below - we are dog-friendly in general.
* General Accessibility Notes: The tables in our dining room are standard height and chairs are movable (no fixed booths that can't be adjusted), so we can accommodate wheelchairs at tables. The garden has paved pathways to the cabins, but a few gravel sections in the open area - just something to note for wheelchair or walker users (though the main patio and cabin area is accessible). If you have any special accessibility needs, feel free to call ahead - we'll do our best to make arrangements (e.g., reserve a table close to the entrance or ensure a clear path).
Amenities:
* Free WiFi: Yes, we provide complimentary WiFi for all guests. The network name is "CornerHouse_Public" and it is an open network that redirects to a simple login page (just accept terms, no password needed). This is provided through the pub's Cloud WiFi system[54]. It's reliable for emails, browsing, even streaming a quick video. If you have any issues connecting, ask the staff for assistance.
* TVs & Entertainment: We have multiple flat-screen TVs in the bar (for sports) and a projector as mentioned. When major games aren't on, the TVs might show news or remain off to preserve atmosphere. We also occasionally project music videos or photo slideshows during events.
* Parking: (Covered above in Contact Info as well) - to reiterate, free on-site parking (limited). Cyclists, we don't have lockable storage but plenty of space to bring bikes into the garden area. No dedicated motorbike parking, but bikes can use a car bay.
* Toilets: We have Men's and Women's restrooms inside, plus the separate accessible toilet. Baby Changing: Yes, a fold-down baby changing table is installed in the accessible toilet (unisex, so whichever parent can use it) - it's stocked with a bin for nappies. We keep it clean and ask all patrons to help us keep it that way for the next parent in need.
* Outdoor Space: Our beer garden is one of our highlights - partially covered, with fairy lights and heaters. In summer, it's a lovely spot with planters and umbrellas for shade. In winter, the cabins and an awning keep it usable. There's no playground, but there is space for kids to stretch a bit (under supervision). Occasionally we'll set up an outdoor grill for special BBQ events in summer.
* Climate Control: Inside, we have central heating for winter (the fireplaces add extra warmth and charm). In summer, while we don't have full air-conditioning (historic building limitations), we keep things cool with open windows, fans, and the thick walls help maintain a decent temperature. The garden has outdoor heaters for chilly evenings.
* Fireplace: Yes, a defining feature - two real fireplaces. In colder months, we light them daily. Seating near the fireplace is first-come, first-served - many regulars love to grab those spots!
* Coat Storage: We don't have a formal coat check, but there are coat hooks and pegs near many tables and by the entrance. In winter, feel free to hang your coat. If you have large luggage (say you popped over from the hotel with bags), just let us know - we can tuck it in a safe corner.
* Phone Charging: We have a few power outlets accessible in the seating areas (not every table, but some along walls). If you're in a pinch and need to charge your phone, you can ask the bartender to plug it in behind the bar or point you to an outlet. We're working on adding some USB charging points in the future. Currently, no dedicated charging station, but we'll always try to help.
Payment Methods:
We accept a wide range of payment options:
* Cash: Yes, cash is accepted (GBP £). We still take good old cash at the bar or table.
* Credit & Debit Cards: Yes, all major cards.
* Visa - accepted [55]
* MasterCard - accepted
* American Express - accepted, though note Amex is less commonly used in pubs, we do have it enabled on our card machine.
* Diners Club/Discover: Not explicitly supported - those are rarely seen, but our machine can sometimes process Discover if it has a chip, though we can't guarantee. Best to use a Visa/Master if possible.
* Contactless: Yes, we have contactless readers. We accept tap-to-pay with cards up to the £100 limit, and for higher amounts you can insert the card with PIN. Most of our transactions nowadays are contactless for speed - just tap and go.
* Mobile Payments: Apple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay - all accepted. Our terminals treat them like contactless cards. If your mobile wallet is linked to a card, it should work fine (no upper limit as long as your device supports authentication for higher amounts).
* Online Payments: If you book an event or something, we can arrange payment via bank transfer by request, but in-house we do not have an online payment portal for regular orders. However, you can pre-pay online if ordering delivery through the apps.
* Gift Vouchers: Currently, we do not sell or accept gift vouchers (no official gift card system yet). This is something we may introduce via Lapen Inns in the future. For now, the best way to "gift" a meal here is to bring your friends or family and treat them in person! (If you have an old Greene King gift card from before our management change, unfortunately we cannot accept those as we're no longer part of that chain.)
* Corporate/Restaurant Cards: We don't have a proprietary restaurant charge card. If your company is footing the bill, they can settle by any of the above methods.
(Our payment process is straightforward - at table or bar. No service charge added automatically to the bill.)
Policies:
* Smoking: No smoking indoors (by UK law). We have a designated smoking area outside - basically the far end of the beer garden has ashtrays on the tables. We kindly ask smokers to use that outdoor area or the front patio and to dispose of cigarette ends in provided ashtrays. The garden cabins are non-smoking (they're enclosed). E-cigarettes/vaping is also not allowed indoors; if you vape, please treat it like smoking and step outside.
* Children: Children are welcome! We pride ourselves on being family-friendly. There is no age restriction for minors, except that under 18s cannot consume alcohol (and should vacate by our closing time). We do ask that after 9pm, if the pub is crowded or showing a late sports match, parents be mindful as it can get loud - but generally kids can stay as long as the family is comfortable. We have board games and a kids' darts board to entertain (ask staff). A Kids' Menu per se is not printed, but we can do half-portions of many dishes or simple kid-friendly meals (see FAQ on kids menu below). High chairs and baby changing provided as noted. Strollers/prams can be brought in (plenty of space in the daytime, might be tighter on busy evenings).
* Dogs & Pets: Dogs are welcome in the pub! We love our furry visitors. Dogs are allowed in the bar area and the garden. We even keep a jar of dog treats behind the bar, so please let us know if your pup deserves one. The only restriction is that in the dedicated dining room, we generally ask that dogs be kept out (for the comfort of diners who may have allergies, etc.), unless it's a quiet time or the dog is a service animal. So if you're bringing a dog and wish to dine, we'll likely seat you in the bar or outdoor area, which most dog owners prefer anyway. Leash policy: Dogs should be kept on a leash and under control. And of course, if a dog is distressed or barking excessively, we might kindly ask to step outside until they're calm, just to maintain a pleasant atmosphere for all. But overall, we are very pet-friendly. Water bowls are available on request.
* Groups: Large groups are welcome, but we do recommend booking ahead for groups larger than 6. We can accommodate big groups by pushing tables together or using our function spaces. For groups of ~8 or more, a reservation helps us prepare staffing and space. For really large parties (20+), definitely contact us in advance - we may suggest a set menu or buffet options to ensure speedy service. We've hosted birthday parties, office gatherings, and even small wedding receptions. There's no strict maximum - we've had 50 people in a section for an event - it just requires coordination. Note that at a certain size (around 15+), we might ask for a deposit or pre-order, especially on busy nights.
* BYO (Bring Your Own alcohol): Not allowed. Since we are a fully licensed venue with our own bar, we do not allow outside drinks to be brought in. (The only exception might be a special wine for a large party, in which case a corkage fee would apply - this is rare and by prior arrangement only.) For cakes or specialty foods (see next point), it's a bit different - we allow celebratory cakes.
* Outside Food: Other than a celebration cake, we kindly ask that no outside food or beverages are consumed on the premises. We have a wide menu to cater to most needs. If you have a special cake or cupcakes for an occasion, that's perfectly fine (see FAQ about birthday cakes). We'll even store it and bring it out with candles if you like. There's no cake cutting fee.
* Service Charge/Tipping: We do not add any automatic service charge to bills for small tables. Your bill will reflect the menu prices and any drinks, and tipping is at your discretion. For groups of 8 or more, we may include an optional 10% service charge on the bill just to make group payments easier - this will be clearly indicated, and you can always adjust it. All tips/service charge go to the staff. If you feel you received great service, tips are appreciated, but there's absolutely no obligation. We want you to feel welcome and not pressured.
* Drunkenness & Safety: As a pub, we promote responsible drinking. We won't serve alcohol to anyone who is excessively intoxicated. Under-25s might be ID checked (bring ID if you look young - Challenge 25 policy). Our security policy is generally relaxed (no bouncers or such, except maybe on New Year's Eve we might have a doorperson). We just ask everyone to behave in a friendly manner - and thankfully, our clientele is lovely.

13. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
Below are answers to some of the most common questions we get from customers. We've grouped them by category for easier reading:
General / Booking (5)
Q1: Do you take reservations?
A: Yes, we do! We highly recommend booking in advance, especially for Friday nights, Saturdays, and Sunday lunch, as those times can get busy. You can reserve a table by calling us at 01223 921122 or by using the "Book A Table" form on our website. For most standard bookings (up to ~6 people), a reservation guarantees you a nice table in our dining area or bar, whichever you prefer. We also accept walk-ins if we have space (see next question), but to avoid waiting, a booking is best for peak times.
Q2: Do you accept walk-ins?
A: Absolutely, walk-ins are welcome! If you find yourself in the area and decide to pop in, we'll do our best to seat you. Many of our weekday guests and even weekend visitors come without a reservation. That said, seating is subject to availability. If we're full, you might have to wait at the bar with a drink until a table frees up. For groups larger than 6, it's safer to book ahead, as arranging seating for big groups on the fly can be tricky during busy periods. But for 1-4 people, walking in is usually fine except perhaps at the height of Sunday lunch rush or when a big football match is on. We've got a spacious bar area, so even if dining tables are full, you might snag a bar table and still order food there.
Q3: What's your cancellation policy?
A: We keep it simple and friendly. For regular reservations, we just ask that if you need to cancel or change the time/size, please give us a call or email as soon as you know - ideally at least a few hours in advance. We do not charge cancellation fees for normal bookings. If you don't show up and haven't informed us, it's not the end of the world, but it can impact our small business (and other guests who could have taken the table), so we appreciate a heads-up. For large group bookings (8+ people) or special events, we may require a small deposit (especially in December or event nights). In those cases, we'll inform you of a specific cancellation policy when you book - typically needing 24-48 hours notice for a full refund of the deposit. Again, we try to be understanding - emergencies happen. Just communicate with us and we'll work with you.
Q4: Do you have WiFi?
A: Yes, we offer free WiFi to our customers. Feel free to get some work done or upload those foodie photos! Just connect to the "CornerHouse_Public" network. It might prompt you to register or accept terms (no password required). After that, you should be online. The signal is strong in all areas of the pub, including the beer garden. If you have any issues connecting, ask one of us and we'll help out. Many guests also end up chatting instead of browsing because the atmosphere is quite engaging - but the choice is yours. Surf away!
Q5: Is there parking?
A: Yes, we have parking. There is a small free car park on-site right next to the pub (entrance from Newmarket Road, look for the sign). It fits about 8-10 cars. If you're coming in non-peak hours, you should find a spot easily. During busy evenings or Sunday lunch, it can fill up, in which case there's alternative parking at the Cambridge Retail Park across the street (they have a large car park, usually free for a couple of hours) and some street parking on side streets like Stanley Road or Harvest Way (check signs for any restrictions). We also have bike racks for cyclists (or you can bring your bike into the garden). Disabled drivers can use our car park; if needed we can cone off a spot if you call ahead to let us know. So, short answer: yes, parking is available - just sometimes you may need to use the overflow options nearby if our little lot is full.
Food & Menu (5)
Q6: Can you accommodate dietary requirements?
A: Definitely. We take dietary needs seriously. Our menu includes a variety of vegetarian and vegan dishes (for example, many of our vegetable curries are vegan, and we have items like Chilli Paneer that can be made without dairy on request). We also have gluten-free options - in fact, a number of Nepalese dishes are naturally gluten-free (like curries served with rice). On our menu, you'll see labels like GF or V next to dishes[56]. If you have an allergy (nuts, dairy, etc.), please inform us - our staff will check with the kitchen and ensure no cross-contamination. We even have a detailed allergy matrix we can show you that lists all common allergens per dish. For example, if you need a dish nut-free, we can often simply omit a topping (like cashew garnish) to accommodate. Halal: Our chicken and lamb are halal-sourced (since our Nepali chefs often use halal suppliers), but please ask to confirm current batches if that's important - we'll gladly clarify. Gluten/Wheat: We have alternatives like gluten-free papadums on hand, and many starters use gram flour which is GF. Spice level: If you can't handle spicy or conversely if you want it extra hot, let us know - we can adjust chili levels on most dishes. Bottom line, we will do everything we can so that everyone can enjoy a meal here, no matter their dietary needs.
Q7: Can I see the menu before visiting?
A: Of course! Our full menu is available on our website. [Click here for our Menu](https://thecornerhousepub.co/menu) - it includes the Nepalese specialties, pub classics, drinks list, everything. We keep it up to date with seasonal changes. If you prefer, we can email you a PDF of the menu as well (just ask). We also have printed menus displayed at our entrance. For takeaway, there's a downloadable menu on the site as well[46]. And if you have specific questions about the menu, feel free to ring us. But yes, checking out the menu beforehand is a great idea - you'll see there's a lot of variety! (Pro tip: reading the menu might make you hungry... we speak from experience.)
Q8: Do you have a kids' menu?
A: We don't have a separate printed "kids menu" pamphlet, but we do cater to children. Many of our dishes can be made in smaller portions or adjusted to be kid-friendly. For example, we can do a mild, non-spicy version of a chicken curry, or simple fish and chips in a half portion for a child. We also have classics like chicken nuggets and fries or a small margherita pizza that, while not on the main menu, our kitchen can whip up for picky eaters (just ask your server, we usually have those basics available). We can also split a dish between two kids if you prefer. And of course, we have ice cream and other desserts that kids love. So, while you won't see a "Kids Combo Meal" printed, rest assured your little ones will find something. If your child has specific favorites, let us know - we might be able to do it off-menu. Coloring sheets and crayons are available to keep them busy until the food comes.
Q9: Do you do takeaway and delivery?
A: Yes we do! We offer takeaway on all our menu items - you can call us to order and then pick it up. We package it up hot and ready to eat at home. Additionally, we're on Uber Eats, Deliveroo, and Just Eat for delivery. So if you're within our delivery radius, you can get our food brought to your door. (There may be a small delivery fee via those apps.) Takeaway is available during our normal kitchen hours. Check out the Delivery & Takeaway section above for full details. But in short: whether you want to swing by and grab it, or have it come to you, we've got you covered. Enjoy our Nepalese curries on your couch if you wish - we won't be offended!
Q10: What are your most popular dishes?
A: Great question - we have a few superstar dishes that guests rave about: - Himali Lamb Curry - Tender lamb in a spiced gravy with mint and Nepalese herbs. This dish is often mentioned as a favorite for its rich, unique flavor.[57] - Momos - These are Nepalese steamed dumplings (we offer chicken or vegetable). They're served with a special chutney and are a must-try appetizer; people absolutely love them. - Goat Curry (Khasi Ko Masu) - A traditional Nepalese goat curry with bold spices. It's not gamey at all - the slow cooking makes it super tender. A rare find in Cambridge and very popular among those in the know. - Mixed Grill Platter - Perfect for sharing, it includes an array of tandoori-grilled meats (and we have a vegetarian grill platter too). It's a hit especially with groups - you get to sample several items like chicken tikka, lamb kebab, etc. - Fish & Chips - Among our British offerings, the classic beer-battered fish and triple-cooked chips is a top seller (we haven't forgotten our pub roots!). - Chicken Chilli (Nepalese style) - A spicy Indo-Chinese fusion dish that's popular for those who like a kick. - Sunday Roast - On Sundays, this competes for top spot. Many come specifically for our roast beef with Yorkshire pud - by word of mouth it's one of the better ones in town.
And to wash it down, our house Nepalese lager ("Gurkha" beer) and cask ales are popular drink choices. But if you ask 10 regulars, you might get 10 different answers - some love our vegetarian Thukpa noodle soup, others swear by the burger. Generally though, the ones above are highly recommended if it's your first visit.
Events & Groups (5)
Q11: Can you host private events?
A: Yes, we can! We're happy to host a variety of private events - from birthday parties and anniversary dinners to corporate get-togethers or club meetings. We have a few options: - Private Dining Room: Our back dining area can be reserved for about up to 30 guests for a semi-private experience. It's separated enough for privacy but not completely closed off. - Beer Garden Cabins: Those heated cabins outside are great for small private parties of 6-8 each. Some groups rent multiple cabins (for example, three cabins to have ~20 people rotating around). - Entire Venue: For larger events (~50-80 people), it is possible to book the entire pub or a major section of it, typically on a quieter night or weekend midday. We've done this for engagements and even a small wedding reception. For full hire, we'd discuss timing and minimum spend, etc.
We can provide tailored catering options for events: e.g., a buffet of Nepalese starters, or set menus. We have done quiz night takeovers, charity events, and live music nights, so we're quite flexible. If you're interested in a private event, please contact our manager via email or phone - we'll walk you through the options and help make it special. (No room hire fee for most scenarios - usually just a deposit that goes toward the bill.)
Q12: What's the maximum group size you can accommodate?
A: In normal service, we can accommodate groups up to about 20 at one table grouping (we'd join tables together in our dining area or set you up in the garden if weather permits). For any group larger than 8, we do appreciate a reservation. For groups larger than 20, we might split you into adjacent tables or discuss a semi-private booking. As mentioned, our entire venue capacity is around 70-80, so we can theoretically host up to that many if it's a private function. For simply a dinner booking, if you have say 30 people, we would likely give you the back room and that's about the comfortable max in one space without taking over the whole pub. So short answer: we've got you covered from couples up to mid-sized parties easily; big events just require a bit of extra planning with us.
Q13: Do you offer set menus for groups?
A: We can, yes. While our standard approach is à la carte, for group events of 10 or more we can certainly arrange a set menu if desired. For example, some groups prefer a fixed price per person that includes a selection of starters, a few mains (served family-style or choice pre-ordered), and desserts. We have done a Nepalese banquet menu for a group - where we bring out platters for the table to share, which is fun and communal. Or if it's a more formal event (say a company dinner), we can do a 3-course set menu where guests choose in advance from 2-3 options per course. Typically, we'll tailor this to your needs and budget. If you don't want the hassle of figuring out everyone's individual orders on the night, this is a good way to go. Just get in touch a week or two in advance so we can plan and possibly print menus. There's no extra charge for doing a set menu, it's just to streamline service. If your group is happy choosing from the regular menu on the day, that's fine too - whatever works best for you.
Q14: Can I bring a cake for a birthday/celebration?
A: Yes, you can! We welcome outside celebration cakes. Birthdays, graduations, etc. - feel free to bring a cake. We'll even store it in our fridge if needed until it's time. When you're ready, our staff can bring it out (we can even sneak candles on and do a little presentation). We do not charge a cakeage fee - it's a celebration, we're happy to be part of it. Plates and forks will be provided for everyone at no charge. Just let your server know that you have a cake and when you'd like it brought out. If you need us to keep it a surprise from a guest of honor, give us a wink - we're good at covert cake operations. One small request: if it's an ice cream cake or something that needs freezer, inform us so we make space. But yes, please do bring that special cake and make yourself at home.
Q15: Do you decorate for special occasions?
A: We do a bit, but it's fairly minimal unless arranged. For example, if you book a table for a birthday and let us know, we might put a "Happy Birthday" balloon or some confetti on the table (if we have on hand), but we don't have a full decorating service. We encourage guests that want more decorations to feel free to bring their own and come a tad early to set up. We're totally fine with you putting up a banner, balloons, table centerpieces, etc., as long as it doesn't damage the venue (e.g., use painters tape or string for banners, not push-pins). If you let us know in advance, we can also coordinate a time for you to decorate. For weddings or big events, we can discuss decorations in detail. Seasonally, note that in December the pub is fully decked out with Christmas decor (tree, lights, etc.), so any December parties will have that festive backdrop. Summarily: we provide the space and base ambiance, any custom decorations for your occasion are up to you, but we're happy to assist in small ways (like bringing out a sparkler on a dessert with a singing staff!).
Accessibility (4)
Q16: Are you wheelchair accessible?
A: Yes, the pub is accessible, with some caveats due to the old building design. We have a ramp at the rear entrance that provides wheelchair access[58][59]. Once inside, all seating areas are on the ground floor with no further steps. We also have a fully equipped accessible restroom on the same level. If you arrive and need assistance, our staff will gladly help with doors or guiding you to a suitable table. The front door has a couple of steps, so the main accessible route is via the back door (from the car park). If you're coming and unsure, you can call ahead and a staff member can meet you outside to show you around. We've had many wheelchair users and those with mobility scooters visit comfortably. The interior aisles are reasonably wide, but during very busy times it can get a bit snug; however, we will make space as needed. We also ensure to keep paths to the restroom clear. So, with the ramp and our staff's help, you should have a smooth experience.
Q17: Are dogs allowed?
A: Yes, dogs are very much allowed at The Corner House. We love pets! All well-behaved dogs (on leashes) can join you in the bar area and outdoor garden. We'll happily bring a water bowl for your pup, and we usually have dog treats behind the bar too (just ask). The only area we try to keep dog-free is the inside dining room when it's in use, out of respect for diners who might prefer not to have dogs around as they eat. But even that is flexible if, for example, the dining room isn't full and your dog is quiet - we won't strictly forbid it. We basically say: dogs in bar = always fine; dogs in dining room = case by case. Assistance dogs are allowed absolutely everywhere, including the dining room, by law and by our welcome. If you bring your dog, please ensure they stay on the leash and are under control (most of our doggie guests are very chill, lying by their owners' feet). If a dog is disruptive (barking continuously), we might ask you to take it outside for a bit just so as not to disturb others - but that's rarely an issue. We do not allow dogs up on the furniture or to eat off our plates (hopefully obvious!). We even hosted a little "puppy party" in our garden once. So yes, feel free to bring your furry friend - they will get lots of pats from our staff.
Q18: Do you have baby changing facilities?
A: Yes, we do. There is a baby changing station in the accessible restroom. It's a fold-down changing table securely mounted, with a sanitizing station nearby. It's kept clean and we check it regularly. If you need anything like a spare wipe or bag, just ask (we usually have some emergency supplies). The restroom is roomy enough for a stroller if you need to wheel one in with you while changing. Additionally, if you prefer a bit more space or a quieter spot to tend to your baby, let us know - we can perhaps offer an unused corner or area if available. We understand the needs of parents (several of our staff are parents too), so we try to make it as easy as possible.
Q19: Do you have high chairs?
A: Yes, we have high chairs available for little ones. We currently have three sturdy wooden high chairs. You don't usually need to reserve them - when you arrive with a baby/toddler, our staff will often ask if you need one, or you can request it. If you have multiple young children and need more than one high chair, it might be worth mentioning when you book or giving a quick call ahead, just so we can set up a suitable table with them ready. Our high chairs have safety straps, and we sanitize them after each use. They're designed for infants who can sit up (generally suitable from about 6 months up to 2-3 years old). If your child is a bit older but still needs a boost, we can provide a cushion or booster (though we don't have dedicated booster seats, the high chairs can be pulled to table height as boosters without the tray). So, rest assured, your little one can sit comfortably and join the family meal.
Payment & Other (3)
Q20: What payment methods do you accept?
A: We accept pretty much everything when it comes to payment: - Cash: Good old cash (£ GBP) is fine. - Credit/Debit Cards: Visa, MasterCard, Maestro, American Express - all accepted. Our card machine will do chip & PIN or contactless. - Contactless & Mobile Pay: Yes, you can tap your card or use Apple Pay/Google Pay/Samsung Pay on our terminal. It's fast and easy. - We do NOT accept: personal cheques, foreign currency, or Diners Club. But those are rare requests. - Split bills: We can also split the bill across multiple cards if your group needs - no problem. Just let us know who's paying what or if you want an even split, we can do that.
There's no surcharge for any payment method. All prices include VAT. If the machine prompts for gratuity, that's optional - you can enter an amount or zero. So use whatever payment method is most convenient for you!
Q21: Do you add a service charge?
A: No, we do not add any automatic service charge to your bill for general dining. The price you see on the menu is what you pay (plus any drinks, etc.), and tipping is entirely up to you. For large group bookings (around 8 or more people) or special event menus, we might include a suggested 10% service charge on the bill, but this will be communicated in advance when you book. Even then, it's usually at your discretion - if you felt the service wasn't up to snuff (heaven forbid!), we would remove it, no questions asked. Our philosophy is that gratuity should be earned and optional. If you do decide to tip, you can do so in cash or ask us to add an amount on the card machine when paying - whatever you prefer. 100% of tips go to our staff team. But again, there is no compulsory charge added by us.
Q22: Can I buy gift vouchers?
A: At the moment, we do not have gift vouchers or gift cards available for purchase. We're a single-location pub (part of a small group) and we haven't set up a formal voucher system yet. It's on our to-do list because we know people love giving the gift of a meal/drinks. In the meantime, if you want to gift someone a Corner House experience, a common approach is to arrange to pre-pay a tab for them - for instance, some customers have left their card details or paid in advance for a bottle of wine for a friend's dinner. We can facilitate that informally if needed - talk to our manager. But as for a nice printed gift certificate, unfortunately not right now. Keep an eye on our website or social media - once we set up a gift voucher program (likely through Lapen Inns), we will announce it. We apologize for any inconvenience; we're flattered you want to share us as a gift!
